 This is a lighting system for a conference room. 
 On detection of a person the door is automatically opened/closed. 
 As the seats get filled the light gets turned on. 
 The rows are filled from row 1 onwards. 
 There are 3 lights per row. 
 As each row begins to get filled the lights get turned on as each rows empties completely the light gets turned off.
